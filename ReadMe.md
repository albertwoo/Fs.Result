# Fun.Result
* This is very opinionated project
* Will make it compatible for both Fable and .NET
* Will continue to add more genral util functions

## Some code is from:

This is a help class library inspired by the sample code from the Scott Wlaschin's book `**Domain Modeling Made Functional** - Tackle Software Complexity with Domain-Driven Design and F#`.

I really like this book and used its knowledge in personal projects and company's projects, and it turns out very great. And this library helps a lot, and I also extended it for a little bit and will add more neat features in the future. I hope this library can help other people to be more productive when doing `Domain Drive Design` (DDD).
